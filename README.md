Smooth scroll
=============

A simple javascript smooth scrolling library for html anchors.
This script is an adaptation of http://www.dezinerfolio.com/2007/08/08/df-javascript-smooth-scroll 

- Very light weight (Just 2KB minified, no need for jQuery)
- Natural easing of scroll speed
- Include script and it works (see `Scroller.init()` in the source file)

### Changes:

- Added element ids as possible target
- Only used on elements that have an existing target
